= Abstract
// Summary, Introduction, Methodology (purposive sampling, qualitative/quantitative), Expected result

Despite the widespread use of raster graphics in games, vector graphics remain underutilized and largely absent, with little integration and no established framework for their effective use in modern game development.
This project introduces #velyst, a streamlined framework for integrating interactive and dynamic vector graphics into real-time video games.
It leverages Typst for vector content creation and Vello for real-time rendering of dynamic vector graphics.
By simplifying the process, this framework enables developers to produce high-quality and engaging content without needing to delve deeply into technical complexities.
This study employs purposive sampling to collect valuable insights from developers in the game development and interactive application sectors.
A semi-structured interview utilizing eight pillar questions was conducted on seven industry professionals with experience in vector graphics and user interface development in order to gain expert insights into current practices, challenges, and opportunities within the field.
Additionally, structured online survey questionnaires were distributed to a total of 33 developers to capture a wider range of opinions on user experiences in current state-of-the-art game engines.
This uncovers the challenges and opportunities of integrating vector graphics, with insights that contributes to the framework on reducing technical barriers, enhancing interactivity, and highlighting areas for further innovation in the field.
This research aims to demonstrate the untapped potential of vector graphics in modern gaming and provide a practical solution for their seamless integration.
This approach contributes to advancing infrastructure and fostering innovation, aligning with the goals of _Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 9_.

// = Conclusion

// Throughout this research, we have explored the evolution of vector graphics, examining its historical roots and tracing its development through to the current modern techniques.
// This investigation has provided a comprehensive understanding of how vector graphics, from their early applications to todayâ€™s dynamic and interactive uses, continue to influence the design and performance of modern digital content.
// On the other hand, research on UI/UX implementations shows the different ways of UI frameworks implementations, namely, IMGUI and RMGUI, with strength and weaknesses evaluated form both sides.
// These insights will help us in developing a more robust framework for #velyst.
// Finally, we also took a deep dive into the tools used in authoring UI elements using markup languages like HTML and CSS.
// It is concluded with Typst as the most suitable authoring tool for #velyst and Vello as the most efficient and future-proof renderer of vector graphics content.

// From the surveys and interviews, we saw a common theme on the lack of robust tooling in terms of integration and flexibility.
// Many developers expressed a desire for improved tools that can streamline the integration of vector and motion graphics into real-time applications and game engines.
// Several challenges were highlighted, such as the lack of seamless interoperability between different platforms, the complexity of dynamic vector graphics integration, and the need for more flexible, customizable toolsets.
// For instance, many participants pointed out that existing tools often require too much technical knowledge or have limitations in terms of performance and flexibility.

// Additionally, the #lumina project, with its focus on dynamic, interactive environments, benefits greatly from these findings.
// The combination of vector graphics, real-time interactivity, and UI/UX integration will play a crucial role in delivering a seamless and immersive user experience.
// These insights will be used to refine #velyst further and explore more robust methods of incorporating dynamic vector content in both #lumina and other future projects.

// Looking ahead, our expectations are focused on the research and development of #velyst into a robust and adaptable framework, one that can cater to the growing demands of modern game development and interactive applications.
// With the integration of advanced vector graphic rendering techniques and improved UI/UX tools, we aim to make #velyst a cornerstone for developers working in dynamic, interactive environments, bringing vector graphics and motion graphics to the forefront of games and real-time applications.
