This project is split into two parts: #velyst and the integration proof-of-concept --- #lumina.
Velyst is created as a separated Rust crate that is completely independent of Lumina.
Lumina utilizes the Velyst crate #footnote()[A crate is just a Rust library.] for all (or at least most) of its UI/UX creation.
This includes titles, buttons, labels, icons, in-game overlay, and many more!

Velyst is an interactive Typst content creator using Vello as the renderer and Bevy as the game engine for driving logic and user interactions.
At it's core, Velyst aims to simplify the integration of Typst into the Bevy game engine.
The goal is to allow developers to create dynamic vector graphics content using Velyst.
Velyst can also be used in combination with other technologies such as SVG and Lottie files.
Developers and artists will be able to leverage the full capabilities of Typst for authoring logic and animation directly inside the language.
Below is a table of developer productivity tools developed inside Velyst to streamline the workflow:
#table(
  columns: (auto, auto),
  [Hot-reloading],
  [
    Whenever the Typst source file changes, it will automatically be re-evaluated on the fly.
    The evaluated source file will produce an accelerated data structure for compilation and layouting at a later phase.
  ],

  [Function Macros],
  [
    Velyst expects developers to create functions in the Typst source file and run them within Rust.
    This is particularly repetitive as users will need to constantly define the function name and arguments.
    Velyst makes this simple by introducing a procedural macro for handling all these on a normal Rust ```rs struct```.
  ],

  [Auto Compilation],
  [
    This ties hand-in-hand with the function macros, all ```rs struct``` that derive the function macro will automatically be eligible for the auto compilation process.
  ],

  [Auto Layout],
  [
    Once the compilation is complete Velyst will automatically layout the compiled content.
    The layouted content will result in a Typst frame which can then be converted into a Vello scene.
  ],

  [Rendering],
  [
    The converted Vello scene is automatically rendered onto the screen with the help of the Bevy Vello crate.
    It utilizes the GPU for accelerated vector graphics rendering.
  ],
)

Concurrent with the development of Velyst, the Lumina game is being built to investigate Velystâ€™s potential use cases in a real world production scenario.
Lumina is a fast paced, top down, 2D, objective based, player versus player (PvP) game.
In the game, players pilot spaceships to complete objectives by depositing lumina into the tesseract to push the tesseract meter.
Players of different teams can also eliminate each other during the match in an attempt to obtain an upper hand.
To win the game, one team will need to push the tesseract meter completely towards the opposing side to obtain total dominance.

The game is heavily physics-driven, with each spaceship consisting of a physics body that interacts dynamically with the environment.
It employs client-side prediction to ensure seamless and responsive physics interactions, maintaining a smooth gameplay experience.
To uphold fair play, all predictions are validated against the server, enabling a fully server-authoritative system that prevents cheating.

Lumina will also employ a custom implementation of global illumination solution using the Radiance Cascades method (Osborne & Sannikov, 2024).
Unlike most 2D games, this game does not use any point or spot lights to illuminate the scene.
Instead, it relies on emissive materials in the scene.
The algorithm will be developed using compute shaders and runs entirely on the GPU.

Lumina features four different levels:
#table(
  columns: (auto, auto),
  [Local Lobby], [Loaded when the player first enters the game.],
  [Multiplayer Lobby], [The waiting area when player enters matchmaking.],
  [Sandbox],
  [Playground and tutorial level where player can get to know the game better.],

  [Abandoned Factory],
  [The in-game map of the game where the deathmatch happens.],
)

The following sections will dive into the design architecture of Velyst and how it is being integrated into the Lumina game.
We will also briefly dive into how Lumina works to provide a better overall understanding of the underlying systems.

@velyst-architect illustrates the architecture of #velyst, detailing the process of transforming a Typst source file into a Vello scene.

#diag_world[
  #cell_diag(blob((0, 0), [Typst World], tint: green))
]

Velyst depends strongly on the Typst world for providing the four foundation pillars:
+ *Files*: Responsible for loading and caching the \*.typ source files and other assets, for instance, images, vector graphics, tables, etc.
+ *Library*: The Typst standard library and user defined variables and functions.
+ *Fonts*: Keeps track of all the fonts available to the compiler.
+ *Datetime*: Provide the current date and time, down to the second!

#figure(kind: image, caption: [Typst world code snippet])[
  ```rs
  /// World for compiling Typst's [`Content`].
  pub struct TypstWorld {
      /// The root relative to which absolute paths are resolved.
      root: PathBuf,
      /// Typst's standard library.
      pub library: LazyHash<Library>,
      /// Metadata about discovered fonts.
      book: LazyHash<FontBook>,
      /// Locations of and storage for lazily loaded fonts.
      fonts: Vec<FontSlot>,
      /// Maps file ids to source files and buffers.
      slots: Mutex<HashMap<FileId, FileSlot>>,
      /// The current datetime if requested. This is stored here to ensure it is
      /// always the same within one compilation. Reset between compilations.
      now: OnceLock<DateTime<Local>>,
  }
  ```
]

#box[
  #diag_world[
    #cell_diag(dotted_blob((0, 0), [ROUTINES], tint: base6))
  ]

  The Typst compiler also stores a number of "routinely" used methods inside a static global variable --- `ROUNTINES`.
  Amongst them, the evaluate --- ```rs eval(..)``` and layout --- ```rs layout_frame(..)``` method is used extensively inside the Velyst pipeline.
]

#let pipeline_colors = (blue, purple, orange)
#diag_world[
  #cell_diag(gradient_blob((0, 0), [Pipeline], pipeline_colors))
]

#figure(
  kind: image,
  caption: [The Velyst render pipeline system sets code snippet],
)[
  ```rs
  pub enum VelystSet {
      /// Loading and reloading of [`TypstAsset`].
      AssetLoading,
      /// Compile [`TypstFunc`] into a [`TypstContent`].
      Compile,
      /// Layout [`Content`] into a [`TypstScene`].

#let func = text(red)[`Func`]
#let cont = text(yellow)[`Content`]
#let frame = text(purple)[`Frame`]
#let vello_scene = text(orange)[`VelloScene`]

The Velyst pipeline might vary slightly depending on the use case.
However, in most scenarios, it begins with creating a native Typst source file within the assets folder.
This source file will be loaded asynchronously into Bevy at runtime through the Bevy asset pipeline.
Once loaded, the Typst compiler _evaluates_ the source file into a #scope, which contains everything defined within the source file.

Velyst allow developers to run any functions defined in the Typst source file.
During this phase the chosen Typst function will be extracted from the #scope and then packed into a #cont data structure.
The #cont is later being used to _layout_ into a #frame.
Lastly, developers can apply any final post-process needed to the #frame which will then be converted into a #vello_scene.

#info_box(
  underline[*What is a #cont?*],
  [
    A #cont is a universal "type" in Typst that packs the information needed to create a renderable #frame view.
    It can be created completely from scratch in Rust or compiled from markdown.
    On rare occasions where developers need to create a #frame completely in the Rust language, they can do so by creating a #cont.
    In addition to that, developers can also modify a #cont using a utility crate that Velyst provides called *_Typst Element_* (see @utility-crate).
  ],
)

#info_box(
  underline[*What is a #frame?*],
  [
    A #frame is a vector graphics format created by _laying out_ a #cont.
    It primarily consists of the shapes, texts, fills, and strokes needed to draw the vector graphics content.
    This also means Velyst can use any rendering backend, with Vello being the one currently in use.
    Velyst also offers a simple post-processing step that developers can apply to a #frame for direct vector graphics manipulation using the *_Typst Vello_* utility crate (see @utility-crate).

=== Velyst Utility Crates <utility-crate>

Velyst provides two utility crates: #typst_elem and #typst_vello.

#underline[#typst_elem]

#figure(caption: [Typst Element utilities])[

  #diag_world[
    #cell_diag(

        [Evaluate],
        tint: blue.mix(green).desaturate(70%),
        shape: octagon,
      ),
      edge("r", "-|>"),
      blob((1, 0), [Scope], tint: blue),
      edge("u,r", "-|>"),
      node((2, -1), [```rs get_value(..)```]),
      edge("d", "-|>"),
      blob((2, 0), [Func], tint: red, shape: hexagon),
      edge("d", "-|>"),
      node((2, 1), [```rs context(..).pack()```]),
      edge("r,u", "-|>"),
      blob((3, 0), [Content], tint: yellow, shape: house),
    )
  ]
]

This crate provides utility tools for creating, modifying, and styling a #cont.
The most crucial function from Typst Element is the ```rs context(..)``` function (@context-func).
It allows developers to to run any function from the #scope and produces a context element which can be packed into a #cont.

#figure(kind: image, caption: [Context function code snippet])[
  ```rs
  pub fn context(
      func: foundations::Func,
      apply_args: impl Fn(&mut SpannedArgs),
  ) -> foundations::ContextElem {
      let mut spanned_args = SpannedArgs::new(func.span());
      apply_args(&mut spanned_args);
      foundations::ContextElem::new(func.with(&mut spanned_args.args))
  }
  ```
] <context-func>

The #func argument required for the ```rs context(func, ..)``` function can be obtained from the scope extension trait:

#figure(kind: image, caption: [Scope extension code snippet])[
  ```rs
  impl ScopeExt for Scope {
      fn get_value<T: FromValue>(&self, var: &str) -> Result<T, ScopeError> {
          self.get(var)
              .ok_or(ScopeError::VariableNotFound)
              .and_then(|value| {
                  value.read().clone().cast::<T>().map_err(ScopeError::ValueCastFailed)
              })
      }
  }
  // Example usage:
  let func = scope.get_value::<Func>("func_name").unwrap();
  ```
]

This crate also provides a huge number of other utility functions using the ```rs fn_elem!(..)``` macro as shown in @fn-elem.

#figure(
  kind: image,
  caption: [```rs fn_elem!(..)``` macro and example use cases],
)[
  ```rs
  macro_rules! fn_elem {
      ($fn_name:ident, $elem:ty, $($param:ident = $in_elem:ty),+) => {
          #[doc = concat!("[", stringify!($elem), "]")]
          pub fn $fn_name($($param: impl Into<$in_elem>),+) -> $elem {
              <$elem>::new($($param.into()),+)
          }
      };
  }
  // Example usage:
  fn_elem!(sequence, foundations::SequenceElem, Vec<Content>);
  // And many more...!
  ```

    )
  ]

]

#typst_vello exposes functionalities that allows developers to apply vector graphics post-processing and convert a #frame into a #vello_scene.
The core data structure of Typst Vello is a `TypstScene` (@typst-scene).
It flattens a vector graphics scene into a vector of groups and allows post-processing to any labeled group content.

#figure(kind: image, caption: [Typst scene code snippet])[
  ```rs
  pub struct TypstScene {
      size: kurbo::Vec2,
      group_scenes: Vec<TypstGroupScene>,
      group_map: AHashMap<Label, SmallVec<[usize; 1]>>,
      pub post_process_map: AHashMap<Label, PostProcess>,
  }
  ```
] <typst-scene>

Below shows how you can label a piece of content in the Typst markdown structure:

#figure(kind: image, caption: [Labeled markdown content.])[
  ```typ
  #box(fill: blue, inset: 1em)[This is a piece of content.] <my-label>
  ```
]

Finally, #typst_vello exposes a ```rs render(..)``` function to render a `TypstScene` into a #vello_scene:

#figure(kind: image, caption: [Render function code snippet])[
  ```rs
  pub fn render(&mut self) -> vello::Scene {
      let mut scene = vello::Scene::new();
      // Setup scene stuff...
      for (i, group_scene) in self.group_scenes.iter_mut().enumerate() {
          // Render the group scenes...
      }
      scene
  }
  ```
]

=== Integration with Bevy's ECS World

The Bevy's ECS world is responsible for managing the entire game logic in #lumina.
It is crucial for the #velyst architecture to integrate seamlessly with Bevy's ECS world.
Velyst uses common Bevy ECS data structures, specifically the _assets_, _resources_, _entities_, and _components_ to communicate between the Typst world and the ECS world.

#figure(caption: [Velyst-ECS communication diagram])[

      blob((6, 4), [Node 6], tint: green),
    )
  ]
] <velyst-ecs-comm>

When a native Typst source file (\*.typ) is loaded into Bevy, it will be stored in Bevy's asset server.
The asset server is responsible for loading, and hot-reloading changes from the source file.
Each source file may contain several Typst functions which can be used to create renderable #vello_scene in Bevy.
These functions are needed to be defined in the Rust source code too.
Fortunately, Velyst provides a simple `TypstFunc` procedural macro for the creation of these definitions (@typst-func-proc-macro).

#block(
  width: 100%,
  align(
    (center + bottom),
    stack(
      dir: ltr,
      spacing: 1em,
      figure(kind: image, caption: [Native Typst function])[
        ```typ
        #let main(data) = {..}
        ```
      ],
      [#figure(kind: image, caption: [`TypstFunc` procedural macro])[
          ```rs
          #[derive(TypstFunc, Resource, Default)]
          #[typst_func(name = "main")]
          struct MainFunc {
              data: Option<Dict>,
          }
          ```
        ] <typst-func-proc-macro>],
    ),
  ),
)

As shown in @velyst-ecs-comm, each function definition is also required to be a Bevy _resource_ so that the Velyst pipeline can pick up information from them.
Inside a Typst function, developers can label parts of their boxed content which will eventually be turned into an entity as an interactable Bevy UI `Node`.
Note that not all functions contain nodes, it should only be added if interaction is required between the content and the user.

#figure(kind: image, caption: [Labeled boxed content in Typst])[
  ```typ
  #let button(label) = [#box[#label] <my-button>]
  ```
]

Finally, Velyst also makes it extremely simple to register these bindings with a simple app extension trait:

#figure(kind: image, caption: [App extension trait])[
  ```rs
  pub trait VelystAppExt {
      /// Load [`TypstAsset`] and detect changes made towards the asset.
      fn register_typst_asset<P: TypstPath>(&mut self) -> &mut Self;
      /// Compile [`TypstFunc`] into [`TypstContent`].
      fn compile_typst_func<P: TypstPath, F: TypstFunc>(&mut self) -> &mut Self;
      /// Layout [`TypstContent`] into [`VelystScene`] and render it into a [`VelloScene`].
      fn render_typst_func<F: TypstFunc>(&mut self) -> &mut Self;
  }
  // Example usage:
  impl Plugin for MainUiPlugin {
      fn build(&self, app: &mut App) {
          app.init_resource::<MainFunc>()
              .register_typst_asset::<MainUi>()
              .compile_typst_func::<MainUi, MainFunc>()
              .render_typst_func::<MainFunc>();
      }
  }
  ```

The team that pushes the bar towards the end will win the game!
